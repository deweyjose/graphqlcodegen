# PR-235: Remote Schema Support & Javadoc Compliance â€” AI Pairing Story

## Context
This PR adds support for specifying remote GraphQL schemas via the `<schemaUrls>` configuration option in the Maven plugin. When a remote schema URL is provided, the plugin downloads the schema and saves it to a deterministic temp file (using the MD5 hash of the URL) under the build directory. These downloaded schemas participate in manifest and change detection just like local files, enabling seamless integration of HTTP(S)-hosted schemas into the code generation workflow.

## Chat & Collaboration Summary
- **Branching & Setup:** We started by checking out and updating `main`, then creating a feature branch for remote HTTP schema support.
- **Implementation:**
  - Added a new `schemaUrls` config option, keeping remote and local schemas separate.
  - Downloaded remote schemas using a utility method, saving them to a deterministic location using an MD5 hash of the URL.
  - Ensured remote schemas participate in the manifest and change detection.
  - Added and refactored tests for remote schema downloading and file saving.
- **User Feedback:**
  - The user provided direct, high-quality feedback, pushing for minimal, idiomatic changes and clear separation of concerns.
  - There was a strong emphasis on not overcomplicating the logic and on following Maven plugin best practices.
  - The user insisted on using the same HTTP download logic as in the bootstrap plugin and on not co-mingling local and remote schema handling.
- **Javadoc & Release Readiness:**
  - During the release process, the Maven Javadoc plugin surfaced errors due to missing or incorrect Javadoc in public classes and methods.
  - The user requested a full sweep to add minimal Javadoc to all public classes and methods, iteratively running the plugin and fixing errors until the build was green.
  - The process included force-updating the release tag multiple times to ensure Maven Central compliance.
- **Technical & Process Learnings:**
  - Fixing initial Javadoc errors in key files allowed the plugin to check the rest of the codebase, surfacing more issues than before.
  - The Javadoc plugin is only active in the `release` profile, so these errors only appeared during publish, not in local or CI builds without the profile.
  - The user values a clean, compliant codebase and is willing to iterate until all release requirements are met.

## Reflections on Collaboration
- The user is highly detail-oriented, expects idiomatic and minimal changes, and is not afraid to push back on suboptimal solutions.
- The AI was used as a rapid prototyping and refactoring assistant, with the user providing course corrections and enforcing high standards.
- The process was iterative, with a focus on both feature delivery and release hygiene.
