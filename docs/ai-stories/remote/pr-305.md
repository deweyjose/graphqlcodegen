# PR-305: Bootstrap Removal, Builder Rename, and Root Flattening

## Context
This PR started as an architecture simplification effort:

1. Re-evaluate whether the bootstrap module was still necessary.
2. Remove complexity that no longer provided enough value.
3. Keep upgrade workflows clear for future maintainers and agents.

During review, the scope expanded to include:
- removing "Generated" naming from the checked-in builder, and
- deleting the `graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin` folder by flattening the project to a single root module.

## Chat Summary

### 1) Deep analysis before changes
- Reviewed both modules and the wiring between them.
- Confirmed the old bootstrap module generated a builder from upstream DGS `CodeGenConfig`.
- Verified where bootstrap helped and where it did not (manual option exposure in `Codegen.java`, `CodegenConfigProvider`, and `CodegenExecutor` still required human/agent updates).
- Validated upgrade/build friction points and safety gaps.

### 2) Simplification step 1: remove bootstrap module
- Deleted `graphqlcodegen-bootstrap-plugin`.
- Vendored builder into the main plugin codebase.
- Removed bootstrap plugin execution and generated-source wiring from Maven config.
- Updated docs and agent guidance for the new workflow.

### 3) Reviewer follow-up: remove "Generated" prefixes
- Renamed:
  - `GeneratedCodeGenConfigBuilder` -> `CodeGenConfigBuilder`
- Relocated package to live with normal source files:
  - `io.github.deweyjose.graphqlcodegen`
- Updated all imports/usages and docs references.

### 4) Final structural request: delete `graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin` folder
- Flattened the repository:
  - moved `graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin/src/...` -> `src/...`
  - removed `graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin/pom.xml`
  - converted root `pom.xml` into the single plugin descriptor
- Updated path-sensitive references:
  - `README.md`
  - `Agents.md`
  - `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`
  - `src/test/java/.../TestUtils.java` remote schema URL path

## Validation
- `./mvnw -pl graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin test` passed during intermediate stages.
- After flattening, `./mvnw test` passed from repo root.
- No remaining references to old module paths in active build/docs/workflow files.

## Commits in this conversation
- `6fb06d9` refactor: remove bootstrap module and vendor config builder
- `060de01` refactor: rename generated config builder and co-locate package
- `fefeed9` refactor: flatten plugin module into repository root

## Collaboration notes
- The maintainer emphasized pragmatic simplification over legacy automation.
- Reviewer feedback was precise and quickly actionable.
- Final state favors a single-module layout, lower build complexity, and clearer maintenance paths for both humans and agents.
