## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Multi-Module Maven Structure & Parameter Automation (PR #216, #217, #225)
- **Multi-Module Setup**: The repo was restructured as a multi-module Maven project, separating concerns and enabling more scalable development.
- **Parameter Generation**: Automated generation of plugin parameters from the Netflix DGS `CodeGenConfig` constructor, ensuring tight alignment and reducing manual errors.
- **Decoupling & Testability**: Core codegen logic was decoupled from Maven internals, introducing abstractions like `CodegenExecutor` and `CodegenConfigProvider` for easier testing and extension.
- **Builder Generation**: Added a Maven goal to auto-generate a Java builder class for plugin parameters, keeping the config surface in sync with upstream changes.
- **Refactor & Bootstrap**: Refactored parameter handling and introduced a bootstrap plugin for streamlined setup.

### 2. Plugin Flattening & Dependency Hygiene (PR #221)
- **Flattened Plugin**: Addressed plugin structure issues, removing unnecessary dependencies and flattening the build for easier consumption and maintenance.

### 3. Code Coverage & Quality Reporting (PR #226, #227)
- **JaCoCo Integration**: Added code coverage reporting with JaCoCo, improving visibility into test coverage.
- **Coverage Publishing**: Automated publishing of HTML coverage reports to GitHub Pages, with links added to the README for transparency.

### 4. Documentation & Process Improvements (PR #228)
- **PR Documentation**: Improved internal documentation and PR write-ups, making the development process more transparent and easier to follow for contributors.

## Repository Structure (Post-PRs)
- **Multi-Module Layout**: Clear separation between core codegen logic, parameter generation, and plugin modules.
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all major logic branches, with automated coverage reporting.
- **Automation**: Parameter and builder codegen, coverage publishing, and plugin bootstrapping are all automated.

---

## Improvements & Future Setup
- **Maintainability**: Decoupling from Maven and explicit config mapping make future changes safer and easier.
- **Extensibility**: New features or config options can be added with minimal friction due to modular design and automation.
- **Correctness**: Automated parameter mapping ensures the Maven plugin stays in sync with upstream DGS codegen changes.
- **Transparency**: Coverage reports and documentation are now easily accessible, supporting a culture of quality and openness.

---

## Going Forward
- **Rapid Adaptation**: The repo is now set up to quickly adapt to upstream changes in Netflix DGS codegen.
- **Contributor Friendly**: Improved docs, automation, and modularity lower the barrier for new contributors.
- **Quality Focus**: Automated testing and coverage reporting will help maintain high code quality as the project evolves.
