# Multi-Module Refactor & Parameter Plugin Integration

## Context
This work was initiated to refactor the `graphqlcodegen` Maven project into a modern multi-module structure, improve maintainability, and enable future extensibility. The main goals were:
- Convert the project to a multi-module Maven setup
- Separate the main codegen plugin and parameter codegen logic
- Enable plugin chaining (run param plugin as part of main plugin build)
- Clean up legacy structure and naming

## Actions Taken
- **Multi-Module Setup:**
  - Created a parent POM (`graphqlcodegen-parent`) to manage shared configuration and dependencies.
  - Split the main plugin into its own module: `graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin`.
  - Created a new module: `paramcodegen-plugin` (later renamed to `graphqlcodegen-param-plugin`).
  - Moved all source, test, and resource files into their respective module directories.
  - Updated all POM references and plugin configurations to use the new structure.
- **Plugin Chaining:**
  - Configured the main plugin module to execute the param plugin during its build process (via `<executions>` in the POM).
- **Naming & Cleanup:**
  - Standardized artifact and directory names for clarity and Maven Central compatibility.
  - Removed obsolete modules and files (e.g., old test modules, core module, etc.).
- **Build & CI:**
  - Ensured `mvn clean install` works from the root and that all modules build and test successfully.
  - Updated spotless and other plugin configs for multi-module support.
- **GitHub & MCP Integration:**
  - Discussed best practices for MCP server repo detection and automation.
  - Confirmed open issues in the repo and provided a summary.

## Outcomes
- The project is now a clean, maintainable multi-module Maven build.
- The main codegen plugin can invoke the param plugin as part of its lifecycle.
- All modules build and test successfully with `mvn clean install`.
- The structure is ready for further extension and easier maintenance.

## Commits Involved
- `f5f8c67` multi module
- `46f60a6` Only publish graphqlcodegen-plugin: skip paramcodegen-plugin deploy and update workflow to deploy only main plugin
- `dcb3920` Bump plugin version to 3.0.1 for new minor release
- `4a98475` Set parent and paramcodegen-plugin to 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT; graphqlcodegen-plugin to 3.0.1 for release isolation
- `96f5306` Fix paramcodegen-plugin <plugin> version to 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT in graphqlcodegen-plugin module
- `04a1a66` Rename graphqlcodegen-plugin module to graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin (artifactId, name, directory, and parent module ref)
- `1f8f700` Rename paramcodegen-plugin module to graphqlcodegen-param-plugin (artifactId, name, directory, and all references)
- `e861daa` Add graphqlcodegen-param-plugin directory after module rename
- `c0ae0af` Merge PR #216: maintenance - param gen setup, and codegen 8.0.4

## AI Pairing & User Interaction Notes
- The user (project maintainer) works in a highly iterative, conversational style, often requesting structural changes, refactors, and best practices for Maven, GitHub, and CI/CD.
- They expect the AI to proactively check, validate, and run commands (e.g., `mvn clean install`, directory/file moves, etc.) and to push back on non-idiomatic ideas.
- The user frequently asks for summaries, documentation, and context to be written as markdown for future contributors or PR reviewers.
- They value automation, reproducibility, and clear documentation of architectural decisions and project history.
- The user leverages the AI for both codebase manipulation and meta-tasks (like summarizing, issue tracking, and CI config), and expects the AI to use available tools autonomously.
- The user prefers that the AI not ask for information that can be discovered from the codebase or repo state, and to use best practices as a default.
