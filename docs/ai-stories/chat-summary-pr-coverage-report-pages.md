# PR: Add Code Coverage Reporting, Badge, and GitHub Pages Publishing

## Summary
This chat documents the process of adding robust code coverage reporting to the `graphqlcodegen` Maven project, including:
- Integrating JaCoCo for code coverage in Maven builds
- Setting up a GitHub Actions workflow for CI coverage reporting
- Uploading coverage reports and generating a badge
- Publishing the full JaCoCo HTML report to GitHub Pages
- Ensuring the badge and PR comments are only updated in the right contexts

## Key Steps & Decisions
- **Branching:** All changes were made on feature branches (`code-coverage`, then `coverage-report-pages`) to keep the main branch clean.
- **JaCoCo Integration:** Added to the parent POM for DRY configuration; only referenced in modules as needed.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
  - Runs on all branches and PRs, but only generates and commits the badge on `main`.
  - Publishes the full HTML report to the `gh-pages` branch for easy browsing.
  - Uses `madrapps/jacoco-report` to post a coverage summary table as a PR comment (with correct permissions).
  - Handles artifact uploads and badge generation only where appropriate.
- **Permissions:** Explicitly set `pull-requests: write` and `contents: write` to allow PR comments and badge commits.
- **README:** Added a badge and a direct link to the live HTML coverage report on GitHub Pages.
- **User Interaction:**
  - The user prefers best practices, clean/idiomatic solutions, and pushes back on unnecessary complexity.
  - Iterative, test-driven approach: changes are tested in PRs, and feedback is quickly incorporated.
  - Values clear documentation and automation for CI/CD.

## Notable Outcomes
- The project now has a visible, always-up-to-date coverage badge on the main page.
- PRs get a detailed coverage table comment, helping reviewers see the impact of changes.
- The full HTML report is browsable via GitHub Pages, linked from the README.
- The workflow is efficient, avoids unnecessary badge churn, and is secure.
